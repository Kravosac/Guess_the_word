# Guess_the_word

The game consists in find the secret word, chose randomly from a big list of words in the file 'words.txt'.
The algorithm segregate the words from this file in 3 leves of difficulty, and remove all the words with less than 5 characters.
Then the user have 7 chances to find the word, chosing a letter each time. If the letter IS in the secret word, the user don't miss that chance.
The game ends when the secret word is found or no more chances are left.
Try it and feel free to suggest me any improvements!
